# 🌱 Greentech Innovation — Computer Vision Training

This repository contains the training files and resources for the **Greentech Innovation Challenge** computer vision project.  
The model was trained for real-time object detection and optimized for deployment on edge devices.

---

## 📁 Project Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Training a custom object detection model using **YOLOv11**
- Exporting the model for **TensorFlow Lite** deployment
- Integration with **Streamlit** for real-time inference on CPU devices
